# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

In this assignment, you will learn to build robust REST APIs using the FastAPI framework. You'll create a complete API with multiple endpoints, implement data validation, handle different HTTP methods, and understand best practices for API development. By the end, you'll have a working API that manages a collection of resources with full CRUD operations.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create a Basic FastAPI Application

#### Description
Set up a new FastAPI project with a basic API structure. You'll create your first endpoints and verify that your development environment is correctly configured. Use the provided starter code as your foundation.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a FastAPI application instance
- Define at least 2 GET endpoints that return data
- Run the application on a local development server
- Include proper response models with type hints
- Have documentation auto-generated by FastAPI (accessible at `/docs`)


### 🛠️ Implement CRUD Operations for a Resource

#### Description
Build a complete API for managing a collection of items (e.g., books, tasks, or students). Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using different HTTP methods. Use an in-memory data structure to store items during runtime.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Accept POST requests to create new items with validation
- Accept GET requests to retrieve all items or a specific item by ID
- Accept PUT requests to update existing items
- Accept DELETE requests to remove items
- Validate incoming data using Pydantic models
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for each operation
- Handle cases where items don't exist (e.g., return 404 errors)


### 🛠️ Add Query Parameters and Error Handling

#### Description
Enhance your API with query parameters for filtering and pagination, and implement comprehensive error handling. This will make your API more flexible and user-friendly.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Support filtering items by at least one attribute using query parameters
- Implement pagination with skip and limit parameters
- Return meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid input, out-of-range values)
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Include proper documentation for all endpoints with descriptions and examples
